        "The Hare and the Tortoise",
        "\nOne day, a hare was showing off how fast he could run. He laughed at the turtle for being so slow. After seeing the overconfidence, the turtle challenged him to a race. The hare laughed at the turtle's challenge and accepted.\n\nAs the race began, the hare ran extremely quickly and went far ahead of the turtle. He thought he had plenty of time to relax, so he lay down to sleep, thinking he would win easily.\n\nHowever, the turtle kept walking slowly but steadily until he arrived at the finish line. When the hare woke up, he saw the turtle had already crossed the finish line. The turtle had won the race.\n            "

        "\nThere was once a proud elephant who enjoyed harassing smaller animals. He would go to the ant colony and shower them with water. The ants, being small, could only cry. The elephant laughed and threatened them.\n\nThe ants had enough and decided to teach the elephant a lesson.\n\nThey entered the elephant's trunk and started causing chaos. The elephant cried out in pain, realizing his mistake. He apologized to the ants and to all the animals he had bullied.\n            "

        "The Lion and the Mouse",
        "\nOnce, a mighty lion lay asleep in the forest. A little mouse came upon him unexpectedly and ran up onto the lion's nose. This woke the lion, who was very angry. He caught the mouse with his huge paw and was about to eat him. The poor mouse begged, 'Please let me go! I promise I will help you someday.' The lion was amused by the idea of a mouse helping him, but he decided to let the mouse go.\n\nLater, hunters captured the lion and tied him up. The mouse heard the lion's roars and rushed to help. He gnawed through the ropes, setting the lion free. The lion realized that even a small creature can be of great help."
